# Spotify-Practice-Aagin-
we are using vite here so we started with npm create vite@latest
2- and then we made the src folder and copy the reqired folders there and we made the file names as vite.config.js to add the vite config there and add the src: root in its last part.
3-also added this   "start": "vite --port 3000 --open --host" in the config
4-Then we added the tailwind css configration 
Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.

5- Then we went to spotify dev site and made an instance of new app and added the redirect ulr
basically what spotify is doing here is when ever some enter to our site we redirect it to spotify api and then spotify alllows thenm to login and then send back to put site again
